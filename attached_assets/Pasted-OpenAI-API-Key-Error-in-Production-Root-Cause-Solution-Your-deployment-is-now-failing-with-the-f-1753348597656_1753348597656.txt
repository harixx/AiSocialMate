OpenAI API Key Error in Production: Root Cause & Solution
Your deployment is now failing with the following error:

text
Error: Missing OpenAI API key
if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) throw new Error("Missing OpenAI API key");
This means your backend server is attempting to access the OpenAI API, but the required OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set in the production environment.

Why This Happens
Your code obtains the OpenAI API key via:

js
var OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.CHATGPT_API_KEY;
if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) throw new Error("Missing OpenAI API key");
In Railway (or any Docker-container or cloud environment), environment variables like OPENAI_API_KEY must be explicitly configured; they are not read from .env files by default unless you set that up manually or declare them in the project’s environment variable section.

How To Fix
1. Set the Environment Variable on Railway
Go to your Railway project dashboard.

Click on your deployed service.

Locate the “Variables” or "Environment" tab.

Add a new variable:

Key	Value
OPENAI_API_KEY	sk-xxxxxxx... (your API key)
Click “Save” or “Deploy” to restart your service with the new variable set.

2. (Optional) For Local Testing
If you also want to run locally, add to your .env:

text
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx...
And ensure you use a package like dotenv to load it in local development.

3. Redeploy Your Service
Once you’ve added OPENAI_API_KEY in Railway, redeploy/restart your service.

The error should disappear and new requests to endpoints requiring OpenAI should now function.

Tips
Ensure you never commit your OpenAI API key to version control (GitHub, etc.).

If you use a different variable name (e.g., CHATGPT_API_KEY), set that as well, or update your code.

For multiple environments (dev, prod), set the correct variable in each.

Table: Common Causes of "Missing API Key" in Cloud Deployments
Cause	How to Fix
Not set variable in cloud dashboard	Add via Railway Dashboard > Variables
Used wrong variable name	Check your code for correct variable name(s)
Overwrote variable during redeploy	Re-add variable after restoring project
Not using dotenv or manual env loader	Make sure local runs use dotenv or similar
