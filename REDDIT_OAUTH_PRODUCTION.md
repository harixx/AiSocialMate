# Reddit OAuth in Production

## Current Development Issue

The Reddit OAuth flow is failing because Reddit cannot reach the development callback URL during authentication. This is a common issue with development environments where the app isn't publicly accessible.

## Solution for Production

### 1. Deploy the Application
To make Reddit OAuth work properly, the application needs to be publicly accessible:

```bash
# Deploy to Replit
npm run build
# Use Replit's deployment feature
```

### 2. Update Reddit App Configuration
Once deployed, update your Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ with the production callback URL:

```
https://your-production-domain.replit.app/thread-discovery/auth/reddit/callback
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Set the production environment variables:

```bash
REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-production-domain.replit.app/thread-discovery/auth/reddit/callback
```

## Development Workaround

For development, you can test Reddit integration without full OAuth by:

1. Using Reddit's RSS feeds (already implemented as fallback)
2. Testing with a publicly deployed version
3. Using ngrok or similar tools to expose your development server

## Current Status

- ✅ OAuth client configuration is correct
- ✅ Callback handling is implemented
- ✅ State verification works
- ✅ Token exchange logic is ready
- ❌ Development URL is not publicly accessible to Reddit

The authentication will work once the application is deployed to a public URL.
